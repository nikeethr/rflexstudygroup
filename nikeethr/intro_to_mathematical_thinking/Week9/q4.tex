Conjecture: Every odd natural number is of one of the forms $4n + 1$ or $4n + 3$, where
$n \in \mathcal{Z}$.\\\\
By the division theorem, any number can be expressed in one of the forms $4q, 4q+1, 4q+2, 4q+3$.\\\\
Of the four forms,\\
$4q$ and $4q+2$ are divisible by 2, and are even.\\
$4q+1$ and $4q+3$ are not divisible by 2 and thus, are odd.\\\\
This shows that the conjecture is true.
