'This page intentionally left blank'
- This statement is not true because if it was, the page would be blank. This is not the case because the above text is printed on it.
- The purpose of this statement is to inform the reader that the page does not contain any relevant information. If the page was truly blank then the reader would not know if the page was intentionally left blank or it was not printed out correctly.
- Historically books are made by folding sheets of paper into 2,4,8 etc. Thus sometimes there may not be enough content to fill all the pages.

Reformation:

- Please turn over.
- This page is moot.
- This page has been left blank except for this sentence.
