Applications
-------------

1) Report generating feature
    Why?
    - Reports are often manually collated and visual preferences are subjective. This can make
      reports time consuming.
    How?
    - Empower users to customize reports (e.g. from data generated from SAS).
    - Learn and automatically schedule/produce graphs and reports for users.

2) Guided learning
    Why?
    - Information overload can be crippling. The idea of this is to take the confusion out.
    - People often get distracted from their goals due to the volatile nature of how today's society
      operates.
    How?
    - Based on principles of flow and deliberate practice.
    - Start with the user's interest, develop a smart way of assessing competancy and provide
      practice recommendations that are slightly above the user's current skill level.
    - Produce statistics and graphs to give user feedback on progress.
    - For example, if one wants to learn guitar, one can start by searching for beginner
      recommendations and upload recordings of their songs. The system will automatically recommend
      the next step to take and techniques to try (e.g. improv/speed/scales/genres) to that are
      relevant to the user's taste and skill level advancement.

3) Computer vision
    Why?
    - Computer vision is fun.
    - For example, one could use crime scene evidence to reconstruct positional information (e.g.
      blood splatter) to judge what is and isn't possible.
    - Another example is using drones to idenify unusual behaviours from tracking pedestrian
      movements.
    How?
    - Get data from internet with lots of images
    - Try out computer vision algorithms to R&D some interesting things.

4) Internet of Things (IoT)
    Why?
    - Want to optimise our experience from our home/work environment, while minimising costs.
    - We are not good at optimising things we don't pay attention to.
    How?
    - By allowing applications to talk to a central controller, various statistics can be gathered
      on usage and user preferences.
    - Optimisation algorithms can be used to switch things on and off in a smart way.
    - Learning user behaviour and preferences can help to provide reminders. e.g. when's the last
      time you did your laundry?
